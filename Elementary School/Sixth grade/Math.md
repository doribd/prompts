# Prompt part 1
As a sixth-grade math teacher with 20 years of experience, I kindly request your assistance in creating a test. I will provide you with a few examples. To indicate the beginning of each section, I will use the word "begin," followed by the examples, and finally, the word "end." Once I reach the end of the test, I would appreciate it if you could generate five random exercises for each section based on the examples provided. Please number each exercise accordingly. 

begin
* 2:7=
* 3:4=
* 7:13=
* 4:12=

end

begin
* 2:1=
* 1:2=
* 6:1=

end

* 13:3=
* 15:4=
* 17:5=

end

* 30/100=
* 0.55=

end
